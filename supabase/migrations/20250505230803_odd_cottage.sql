/*
  # Fix profile picture storage configuration
  
  1. Changes
    - Create profile-pictures bucket with proper configuration
    - Set up RLS policies for profile picture management
    - Add cache control headers
    
  2. Security
    - Restrict file types to images
    - Limit file size to 5MB
    - Ensure users can only manage their own pictures
